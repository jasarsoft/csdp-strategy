## C# Design Patterns: Strategy
### by Filip Ekberg

As your applications grow, you can often find areas which you want to extend. But due to lack of separation and coupling of concrete implementations this can sometimes be hard. An extremely common approach is to leverage interfaces to solve this, which brings us to the strategy pattern. In this course, C# Design Patterns: Strategy, you’ll learn foundational knowledge of the strategy pattern. First, you'll learn how to identify situations where this pattern is applicable. Next, you’ll discover how to easily refactor an application to leverage the strategy pattern, making the application extensible, testable, and easier to work with. Finally, you'll explore how to identify existing implementations of this pattern. When you’re finished with this course, you'll have the skills and knowledge of the strategy pattern needed to apply this in your solutions.
